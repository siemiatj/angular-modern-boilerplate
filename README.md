## What & why ?
Have you ever found yourself in need of a basic Angular boilerplate, with Webpack and Babel already set-up ? Ready to write and run Karma unit tests ? No BS stupid app, generators, bower ? Well, here you go.

## What's included ?

* Webpack
* BabelJS
* Bootstrap
* Angular-Bootstrap
* Karma
* ESlint
* JShint

## Setup 
You need node with npm and `grunt-cli` installed. Then run:

`grunt build`

to build the application.

## Tests
This app comes with Karma preconfigured. In order for it to pick up your test cases just suffix them with `spec.js`.
Then run:

`grunt karma`

## ES6
Webpack is configured to compile files live. To use ES6 sugar suffix your scripts with `es6`.
